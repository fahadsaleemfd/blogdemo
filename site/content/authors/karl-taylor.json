  "description": "Karl is incredibly committed to the creation of an impactful strategy, effective communication, and a vibrant and dynamic culture. By adapting innovative tactics to meet the unique needs of each client, he helps businesses engage with their target audiences on a deeper level. In his view, the tone with which we express ourselves is as crucial as the actual words we choose to use. He also thinks that believing in the immense power of our work—in its success and its failure—is essential for authenticity and making a difference. Partnerships and growth do not happen by accident, but rather as a result of an atmosphere that values and rewards innovation and quality. In his spare time, he hikes, takes pictures, writes music, reads, and watches TV.",
